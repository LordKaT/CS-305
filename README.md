##Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial, a top-tier consulting firm, specializes in creating customized financial plans for a diverse clientele, covering investments, savings, retirement plans, and more. Recognizing the need to protect sensitive personal and financial information, they hired our team to develop a secure public web application. Our goals were to create a user-friendly platform that ensures seamless client interaction while integrating advanced security measures. This approach guarantees the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data, aligning with industry standards and regulations. Our mission combined delivering cutting-edge functionality with robust security protocols to enhance Artemis Financial's service delivery and client trust.

##What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I excelled at identifying current vulnerabilities in the codebase using static testing techniques. Secure coding practices are crucial for preventing data breaches and protecting the company's reputation for integrity and reliability.

##Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The dependency check tool proved to be incredibly helpful, significantly saving time by automatically detecting vulnerabilities rather than requiring a manual review of each dependency.

##How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Implemented multiple security measures. I securely stored and transmitted sensitive data like contact details and appointment schedules using encryption for both data at rest and in transit. For instance, the local database and client-server communications utilized HTTPS. I also employed secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), rigorously applying input validation to sanitize user inputs. In future projects, I would combine automated tools and manual code reviews to assess and mitigate vulnerabilities. Tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite can quickly spot common security issues, while manual reviews would provide more detailed assessments. Additionally, threat modeling would help identify and prioritize potential attack vectors, allowing for a focused approach on critical vulnerabilities.

##How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure functionality and security, I used comprehensive unit and integration testing, secure coding practices, and regular peer code reviews. After refactoring, I reran automated tests, used static analysis tools for vulnerabilities, and conducted a manual security review. Regression testing confirmed that no new issues were introduced, maintaining overall security and functionality. These steps robustly safeguarded against errors and vulnerabilities.

##What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
In this project, I used several key resources, tools, and coding practices that I'll definitely rely on for future assignments. Git was super helpful for version control, allowing me to track changes and collaborate easily. JUnit was great for automated testing and helped me stick to Test-Driven Development (TDD) to keep the code quality high. I also used static analysis tools like SonarQube and Checkmarx to automatically catch security vulnerabilities and code quality issues. Sticking to secure coding practices, like input validation and encryption, made sure the application was secure. Regular peer code reviews added another layer of quality control, catching issues that automated tools might miss. These resources and practices not only made the project successful but also set a solid foundation for future software development.


##Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, several key elements would highlight my skills, knowledge, and experience to future employers. I would showcase the well-structured code and thorough testing with JUnit and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to prove my commitment to high-quality, maintainable code. Additionally, I'd present my secure coding practices, such as input validation, encryption, and proper error handling, to show my understanding of security best practices. Sharing results from static analysis tools like SonarQube would further demonstrate my proactive approach to identifying and fixing vulnerabilities. I'd also highlight my use of Git for version control, illustrating my ability to manage changes effectively and collaborate with others. Examples of peer code reviews would showcase my collaborative spirit and attention to detail. All these elements would collectively demonstrate my technical proficiency, security awareness, and effective teamwork, making a strong case for my future roles.
